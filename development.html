        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Candy Shop React Interface</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> React Aggregating + Filtering + Sorting </p>
        <h2>Part 0: Project Motivation and Overview</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p>In this project, I explore the development process of an interactive interface in React by using
                interface components, tying the components to an internal data state, and implementing aggregator,
                filter, and sort functions.
                This is my first experience with React, and I decided to develop a rather simple website that represents
                a
                candy shop where users can choose snacks that they want, as well as filter by
                type and size of snack and sort by price (ascending or descending). <b>I love snacks so this was
                    extremely
                    fun
                    to make! </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Part 1: Overall Goal and Value of Application</h2>
        <p>The goal of my application is to represent an online snack shop where users can sift through a
            collection of snacks and add and remove snacks from their cart. The cart keeps
            track of the number of each snack as well as a price total. The
            user may be craving a specific snack type (i.e. chips, candy, cookies) and can filter by the type of snack
            they want. They may also be looking for a specific snack size (i.e. individual, family, party) depending on
            the purpose for purchasing the snacks, so they can also filter by size as well. They may want to sort the
            snacks from least to most expensive or most to least expensive so there are two sort options for those
            capabilities as well. </p>
        <h3 style="color: black">Considering Usability Principles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The filters and sort capabilities should be placed at the top and centered on the page so the user can
                easily
                see and select the filter/sort that they want.</li>
            <li>The filters should use checkboxes while the sort should use circular radio buttons since multiple
                filters can be
                applied but only one sort function can be used at a time, matching the user's mental model.</li>
            <li> The 'Add to Cart' and 'Remove from Cart' are different colors, and more specifically, the 'Remove from
                Cart' button is outlined in red to match the user's mental model that red means stop/remove.
            <li>The cart, which is purposely located toward the top of the screen, reminds users what snacks are
                actually inside, including the quantity and price of each snack as well as the total cart price. Users
                should not have to scroll down to find the price of a specific snack in
                their cart, mentally keep track of the quantity of each snack, or manually calculate how much they need to pay.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Part 2: Components</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-1"></div>
            <div class="col-md-6"> <img style="width: 90%" src="./component.png" alt="toaster oven sketch"> </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 d-flex justify-content-center" style="flex-direction: column">
                <h3 style="color:black">Snack Component</h3>
                <p> The Snack component contains important details about each snack, including an image, name, type
                    of snack, size, price, add to cart button, and remove from cart button. These are laid out in
                    Bootstrap grid fashion on the page of the application.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: User-Triggered State Changes </h2>
        <h3 style="color: black">Filtering and Sorting</h3>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-items-start justify-content-center">
                <div class="card mb-3" style="width: 70%; height: 100%">
                    <img src="./filters.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Filters">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title">How Filtering Works</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">When the user selects/de-selects a certain filter such as one of the snack
                            type filters, the filter is added to/removed from an array state variable called
                            'typeFilters' that contains all the snack type filters that are selected (via a
                            setter function). Then, based on the
                            'typeFilters' array, the state variable called 'type' may change. If no type filters are now
                            selected, then 'type' is set to "all" and all snack types are shown; if one type filter is
                            selected, then 'type' is set to that specific snack type and only snacks of that type are
                            shown; if more than one type filter is selected, type is set to "none" and no snacks are
                            shown since each snack is only of one type. The same process is used for the snack size
                            filter. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 d-flex justify-content-center">
                <div class="card align-items-center" style="width: 70%; height: 100%">
                    <img src="./sort.png" class="card-img-top w-75" alt="Sort">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title">How Sorting Works</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">I also use a state variable for the 'sortType' (price ascending or price
                            descending), which utilizes the setter function 'setSortType.' When the user selects a type
                            of sort, the 'sortType' is altered through 'setSortType,' and the appropriate sorting
                            function is used on the (filtered) 'snackData.' </p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">How The Cart Works</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">When the user clicks 'Add to Cart' or 'Remove from Cart,' the 'cart' state
                            variable is modified through the 'setCart' setter function (passed in as the handler) and
                            updated on the screen.

                <p> The final website can be accessed by clicking on 'Final Website' above. This was definitely a
                    difficult project
                    with many technical coding elements rather than just design; however, I became a lot more
                    comfortable with React
                    and the use of State, which will allow me to build many more interactive websites in the future! I
                    hope you enjoy my
                    candy shop (even though you can't actually order anything)!
