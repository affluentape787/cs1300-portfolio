        <p style="text-align: center;"> User Research + Personas + Storyboarding</p>
        <h2>Part 0: Project Overview</h2>
        <p> I absolutely love eating warm bread and pastries. In this project, I explore a
            classic UX task with a toaster oven interface where I
            observe users interacting with a
            toaster oven, interview them about their experiences, form two personas, and sketch out a
            storyboard. I hope you enjoy!
        </p>






        <h2>Part 1: Interface Sketch and Description</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-1"></div>
            <div class="col-md-6"> <img style="width: 90%" src="./ToasterSketch.jpg" alt="toaster oven sketch"> </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 d-flex justify-content-center" style="flex-direction: column">
                <h3 style="color:black">About This Toaster Oven:</h3>
                <p>This toaster oven interface strives to address difficulties a user may encounter when
                    customizing settings for their
                    specific food-heating objective. The interface features a <b>large handle</b> to open the front
                    glass
                    cover
                    and three separate <b>rotating
                        knobs</b> for temperature, mode (i.e. bake, toast, broil, or air fry), and time customization.
                    It
                    also
                    includes <b>visual indicators</b> on
                    the time knob so a user can set a specific burn level for their toast as well as a <b>bright orange
                        light indicator</b> at the bottom
                    to show when the oven is on.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Key Observations of Three Users (A, B, and C)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users A and B put the item into the oven and closed the door before looking at the knobs. User C
                held their bread and adjusted the first two knobs before putting the bread in.</li>
            <li>When looking at the knobs, all users bent over so that they were at eye level with the
                knobs. User C stared at the interface for a few seconds before actually touching the
                knobs while the other users immediately started to move knobs.</li>
            <li> Users B and C had furrowed eyebrows and squinted as they looked at or used the knobs.</li>
            <li> User A only turned the bottom two knobs, disregarding the temperature knob, while the other two
                users moved all three of the knobs in order from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> Only User C had the temperature knob turned to the toast preset even though all users were using
                the oven to toast something.</li>
            <li> Once the timer started to tick, all the users would look and scroll or
                type on their phone. User C peered through the glass one more time before looking at
                their phone. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 3: Prepared Interview Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What was your first reaction upon seeing the knobs on the toaster oven?</li>
            <li>What was the most difficult step to accomplish when using the toaster oven?</li>
            <li>Imagine you are living in your <b>ideal</b>, dream-world. What are some features that your toaster
                oven would have?</li>
            <li>How many times have you used a toaster oven in the past seven days?</li>
            <li>What do you most frequently use a toaster oven for? </li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Part 4: Takeaways from Interview Responses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All users were using the toaster oven to toast either a piece of bread or croissant, and most of
                them were looking specifically for a 'toast' option when they first approached the toaster oven.
            </li>
            <li> For most users, the presence of three knobs coupled with many different settings and numbers in
                small fonts was confusing.</li>
            <li>The two most common difficulties users had with the toaster oven were figuring out what temperature
                to use and making sure the notches on the knobs aligned perfectly with the options they wanted.
            </li>
            <li> Some ideal toaster oven features mentioned by users included: precise control over temperature and
                time, one-button presets for common toasting preferences, and a large screen that displays the
                inside of the oven at any given time. <i>(Sidenote: I loved hearing about these cool features!)</i>
            </li>
       
        </ul>

                            the
                            office every morning
                            but wants to
                            fit in a quick breakfast before work. She despises having to figure out a bunch of complex
                            buttons or
                            knobs on a toaster oven.
                            Hurried Hannah represents how two of the users I observed started to turn the knobs without
                            ever pausing
                            to examine them first and how one user did not even bother to adjust temperature.
                            Additionally, all
                            users occupied themselves with something on their phone almost immediately after the toaster
                            oven timer started, indicating that they had other tasks to attend
                            to.</p>

                            identical
                            breakfast every
                            morning and is
                            very particular about his food. He does not like how he has to eye the temperature and time
                            using the
                            knobs on the toaster oven and wishes he had access to more precise temperature and time
                            increments.
                            Meticulous Michael reflects how some users were more careful when preparing to toast. One
                            user stared at
                            the knobs for a couple seconds before adjusting the settings. Two of the users also
                            squinted their eyes and furrowed their eyebrows as if focused on analyzing the knobs. One
                            user also
                            double checked the knobs and glanced inside the toaster oven before parting from the
                            toaster.</p>

        <h2>Part 7: Storyboard - Meticulous Michael</h2>
        <p> A storyboard is often used to predict a user's experience with a certain product. The following (roughly
            sketched) storyboard demonstrates how a person like Meticulous
            Michael might use the toaster oven from beginning to end. </p>

        <h5 style="text-align: center"> Thanks for going on this journey with me! I had a lot of fun
            learning about how people use toaster ovens and about the different steps in the process of creating
            personas
            and storyboards. I hope you also learned a thing or two about this process, but if not, I hope you got a
            good laugh from my drawings!</h3>
